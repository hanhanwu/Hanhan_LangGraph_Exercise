* [How to Run DeepSeek R1 through vLLM][2]
  * On Google Colab, at least needs T4 GPU as runtime 

* [SQL Agent with OpenAI][1]
  * This agent can write SQL, execute SQL, rewrite failed SQL, output results 
  * When SQL execution failed, LLM checks failed SQL and try to write a better one
  * There is SQL rewrite limit, so this agent knows when to give up ðŸ˜‰
  * When there's no data supports user's question, the agent won't waste time to write any SQL
 
* [SQL Agdent with SQL Logic Validation][3]
  * Comparing with the above SQL agent, it has added SQL logic validation. But to be honest, I think the best way to validate SQL query is to execute it.
 
* <b>More Ideas</b>
  * Apply [TabGLM][4] on the tabular data
  * [Some lessons learned from Timescale][5]
